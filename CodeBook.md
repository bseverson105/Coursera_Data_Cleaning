Conslidated Stats Codebook
--------------------------
The output of the "run_anlaysis.R" script generates a consolidated view of the research data.  All of the test and training data is aggregated into one data table.  An average for every variable containing a mean or standard deviation is then presented in groups by subject and activity.  The original data had many more features than those describing mean and standard deviation and the data was not grouped by the subject or activity.  

For a full description of each description, please reference the features_info document present in the original dataset.  None of the manipulation done by run_anlaysis.R modified the underlying logic behind any of the features, it just grouped them differently and consolidated them into averages based on the groups.
